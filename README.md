# DMP

The World Food Program Cambodia supports the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) and their provincial counterparts (PCDM) on the use of mobile data collection tools to capture information on disasters.

This DMP project is a form management tool. It provides the ability to manage users and campaigns as it relates to the disaster relief within Cambodia's provinces.
